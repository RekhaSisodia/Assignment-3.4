Assignment 3.4

Ques1. Import the Titanic Dataset from the link Titanic Data Set.
Perform the following:
a. Preprocess the Passanger Names to come up with a list of titles that represent families and represent using appropriate visualization graph.
b. Represent the proportion of people survived from the family size using a graph.
c. Impute the missing values in Age variable using Mice Library, create two different graphs showing Age distribution before and after imputation.
   library(mice)
   library(ggplot2)
   library(Amelia)
   Titanic$age<-as.factor(Titanic$age)
   missmap(Titanic[-1],col=c("Red","Royal Blue"),y.cex=0.5,x.cex=0.8)   # Graph before the imputation of missing value

   # Imputation of missing values
   library(ggplot2)
   library(mice)
   library(Amelia)
   Titanic[is.na(Titanic$age),]# quite many rows as suggested above
   Titanic$age[which(is.na(Titanic$age))] <- mean(Titanic$age,na.rm = TRUE)
   Titanic[is.na(Titanic$age),] # "na" values have been replaces by mean of rest of the values
   View(Titanic)

   ggplot(Titanic,aes(x=0.8,y=0.5))+
   geom_boxplot(fill="Red",color="Blue")        #Graph after the imputation of missing values
